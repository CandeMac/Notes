# 2 CYSA PLUS - Jason Dion - Section 2 
## Section 2: ID Security Control Types

### Domain 5.3: 
- Explain the importance of frameworks, policies, procedures, and control


### Cybersec Roles and Responsibilities (OBJ 5.3)
- What roles exist in Cybersec domain?

##### Cybersec Specialist/Tech (Entry) 
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Analyst (Mid Level)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Consultant (Mid Level)
:arrow_right_hook: PenTester (Mid Level)

##### Cyber Crime Analyst/Investigator (Entry)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Analyst (Mid Level)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Consultant (Mid Level)
:arrow_right_hook: PenTester (Mid Level)

##### Incident Analyst/Responder (Entry)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Analyst (Mid Level)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Consultant (Mid Level)
:arrow_right_hook: PenTester (Mid Level)

##### IT Audtor (Entry)
:arrow_right_hook: Pentester (Mid)

##### Cybersec Analyst (Mid)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Manager/Admin (Advnaced)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Engineer (Advanced)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Architect (Advanced)

##### Penetration Tester (Mid)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Engineer (Adv)
:arrow_right_hook: Cybersec Architect (Adv)

##### CISO (Exec Level)

#### Cybersec Analyst
- A senior position within an org's security team with direct responsibility for protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access to electronic data and the systems that protect it
- Junior and Senior analysts
- Junior still has 2-3 years experience in cybersecurity/IT realm
- CISO Chief Info Sec Officer 

#### Functions Cybersec Analyst Performs 
- Implement and config sec controls
- working in SOC or CSIRT
- Auditing sec processes and procedures
- Conduct risk assessments, vuln assessments, and pen tests
- Maintaining up-to-date threat intelligence
- Advise on legal, compliance, regulatory issues

#### What makes a good Cybersec Analyst?
- Be a problem solver and creative thinker
- Put together lots of information and make sense of it
- Be able to explain the issue in nontechnical terms
- High pressure, think on feet

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- A location where sec professionals monitor and protect critical information assests in an organization (Security Monitoring Center)
- Usually exist for large corps, government agencies, and health care orgs
- Small companies outsource

#### SOC Must-Haves
- Authority to operate, make decisions during attack
- Contain motivated and skilled professionals
- Incorporate processes into a single center (NOT A SERVICE DESK)
- Equipped to perform incident response
- Protect itself and the org at large
- Separate the "signal from noise" : large amounts of data, automation
- Collab with other SOCs to share data

#### SOC should be the single point of contact for security, monitoring, and incident response 

### Security Control Categories (OBJECTIVE 5.3)
#### Security Control
- A technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk in order to ensure the confidentiality, integreity, availability, and nonrepudiation of data and information 
- CIA Triad
- Used to put controls in place reactively, always one step behind
- Risk mngmt control, select and deploy in a structured manner using overall framework
- Defense in Depth

#### NIST 800-53
- Security and privacy controls for fed info systems and orgs
- 18 Families : AA - Accountability, IR - Incident Response, RA - Risk Assessment ...etc.
- ISO 27001, world wide but not free
- In earlier NIST 800-53 each control belonged to classes
-- Technical (Logical) Controls : Security controls that is implemented as a system (Hardware, Software, or Firmware)
-- Operational Controls : Implemented primarily by people rather than systems
-- Managerial Controls: Provide oversight of the information system
- Sometimes they merge together, so other categories created, NIST no longer uses them to avoid confusion

### Functional Control Types

#### Preventative Control
- Acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed
- EX: Firewall ACL, anti-malware
#### Detective Control
- Control that may not prevent or deter acces, but will id and record any attempted or successful intrusion
- EX: logs, security camera
#### Corrective Control
- Eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event
- EX: backup logs, patch mngmt systems

No single control will be perfect, everything has a vulnerability. Judge efficiency by how long it delays an attack

#### Physical Control
- Type of security control that acts against in person intrusion attacks
- EX: Door locks, Mantrap, Security Guard, locks, lighting, fence

#### Deterrent Control
- A type of security control that discourages intrusion attempts
- ADT security sign

#### Compensating Control
- Substitute for a principal control, next best option or different way of achieving goal
- EX: crazy long secure passwords VS smartcard and pin (MFA)

### Selecting Security Controls 
#### CIA Triad
- Consider all three working together
